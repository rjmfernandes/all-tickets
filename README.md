# All Tickets - Chrome Extension for Zendesk

This is a Chrome extension for presenting all tickets 
of an organization from Zendesk in a single page.

Go to chrome://extensions/ and make sure developer 
mode is enabled.

Click Load Unpacked, and then select the extensionâ€™s 
directory. 

Once you have it loaded, go to your extensions in 
the toolbar and click the puzzle piece. Scroll down 
until you find the extension and then pin it to your 
toolbar.

You can click on it once you are in an organization 
page in Zendesk to show all tickets listed in a new 
tab.
